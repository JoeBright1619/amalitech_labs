# AmaliTech Labs

Welcome to the AmaliTech Labs monorepo. This repository contains a collection of Python-based labs and modules designed to demonstrate best practices in software development, including TDD, clean architecture, and robust error handling.

## Structure

The project is organized into modules, each containing several hands-on labs.

### [Module 2](file:///d:/projects/amaliTech/amalitech_labs/module_2)
- [**Resilient Data Importer CLI**](file:///d:/projects/amaliTech/amalitech_labs/module_2/resilient_data_importer_cli): A robust command-line tool for data ingestion with custom exception handling and logging.
- [**Secure Service Module with TDD**](file:///d:/projects/amaliTech/amalitech_labs/module_2/secure_service_module_with_tdd): A user authentication service built following a strict TDD process, focusing on security and decoupling.
- [**TDD-based API Service Stub**](file:///d:/projects/amaliTech/amalitech_labs/module_2/tdd-based_api_service_stub): A weather forecast service demonstrating service stubs, structured logging, and advanced TDD patterns.

## Getting Started

Each lab is a independent project with its own `pyproject.toml` (for Poetry) or `requirements.txt`. To work on a specific lab, navigate to its directory and follow the instructions in its local `README.md`.

### General Prerequisites

-   Python 3.8+
-   [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) (highly recommended for dependency management)

## Key Concepts Covered

-   **SOLID Principles**: Creating maintainable and testable code.
-   **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Ensuring code correctness from the start.
-   **Exception Handling**: Building resilient systems that handle errors gracefully.
-   **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns and dependency inversion.
-   **Professional Workflow**: Standard Git practices, linting, and formatting.
